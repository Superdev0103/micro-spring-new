In this project I'm demonstrating you the most interesting features of [Spring Cloud Project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) for building microservice-based architecture.

## Getting Started 
Currently you may find here some examples of microservices implementation using different projects from Spring Cloud. All the examples are divided into the branches and described in a separated articles on my blog. Here's a full list of available examples:
1. Using Spring Cloud Netlix **Eureka** as a discovery server, **Zuul** as a gateway, **OpenFeign** for communication and Spring Cloud Config Server. The example is available in the branch [master](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/master). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Quick Guide to Microservices with Spring Boot 2.0, Eureka and Spring Cloud](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2018/04/26/quick-guide-to-microservices-with-spring-boot-2-0-eureka-and-spring-cloud/)
2. Using Spring Cloud Alibaba **Nacos** as a discovery and configuration server, **Zuul** and **OpenFeign**. The example is available in the branch [alibaba](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/alibaba). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Microservices with Spring Cloud Alibaba](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/microservices-with-spring-cloud-alibaba/)
3. Using Spring Cloud with Spring Boot support for **GraphQL** for building microservices, **Apollo** for inter-service communication and **Eureka** as a discovery server. The example is available in the branch [graphql](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/graphql). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [GraphQL â€“ The Future of Microservices?](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2018/08/16/graphql-the-future-of-microservices/)
4. Using Spring Boot and partially Spring Cloud for building microservices deployed on **OpenShift** with **Source-2-Image** mechanism. The example is available in the branch [openshift](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/openshift). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Running Java Microservices on OpenShift using Source-2-Image](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/running-java-microservices-on-openshift-using-source-2-image/)
